# valentine

An interactive and charming website asking the most important question: **"Will you be my Valentine?"**.  
Say "yes" and get a sweet surprise, say "no"... well, I’ll keep asking until you change your mind! 😏

## ✨ Features
- **Interactive Buttons**: The "No" button delivers increasingly dramatic messages each time you click.  
- **Dynamic Growth**: The "Yes" button grows larger, demanding your attention.  
- **Cute Response Pages**:  
  - **Yes Page**: Adorable GIF to celebrate your decision!  
  - **No Button**: Endless persuasion messages with fun, playful animations.
